# 🚀 Day 06 – Linux Fundamentals: Read & Write Text Files

As part of my **#90DaysOfDevOps** journey, today I practiced basic Linux file handling using redirection, tee, cat, head, and tail commands.

---

# 🟢 Stage 1 – File Creation & Initial Write

## 🧑‍💻 Commands Used

```bash
ls
echo "this is my linux practice notes" > notes.txt
echo "today we are practicing basic read and write commands" >> notes.txt
cat notes.txt
```

## 📖 Explanation

- `ls` → Lists files in the current directory.
- `>` → Creates or overwrites `notes.txt`.
- `>>` → Appends new content to the file.
- `cat` → Displays the complete file content.

# 🟢 Stage 2 – Using tee Command

## 🧑‍💻 Commands Used

```bash
echo "Using tee to write and display output" | tee -a notes.txt
cat notes.txt
```

## 📖 Explanation

- `tee -a` → Appends content to the file.
- It also displays the output in the terminal.
- `cat` verifies the updated file content.

# 🟢 Stage 3 – Appending Multiple Lines & Final Verification

## 🧑‍💻 Commands Used

```bash
echo "Learning how to use echo and save output to a file" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to view file content using cat" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to see the first few lines of a file using head" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to see the last few lines of a file using tail" >> notes.txt
echo "regular Linux practice improves skills" >> notes.txt

cat notes.txt
head -n 2 notes.txt
tail -n 2 notes.txt
```

## 📖 Explanation

- Multiple `>>` commands appended new lines.
- `cat` displays the complete file.
- `head -n 2` shows the first two lines.
- `tail -n 2` shows the last two lines.

# 📚 Commands Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `ls` | List files in directory |
| `>` | Overwrite or create file |
| `>>` | Append content |
| `tee -a` | Append + display output |
| `cat` | Read full file |
| `head -n` | Read first lines |
| `tail -n` | Read last lines |

# ✅ Learning Outcome

- Understood overwrite vs append
- Practiced file creation and modification
- Used tee effectively
- Strengthened Linux command-line fundamentals

**Linux basics strong = DevOps foundation strong 💪**
