# 📘 Day 06 – Linux File Handling Practice

This document records a structured practice session focused on basic Linux file operations.

---

## 📌 Objective

This practice covers:

- File creation
- Overwriting vs appending
- Reading full file content
- Viewing partial content
- Using `tee` command
- Verifying outputs

---

# 1️⃣ File Creation & Initial Write

### 🔹 Commands Executed

```bash
ls
echo "this is my linux practice notes" > notes.txt
echo "today we are practicing basic read and write commands" >> notes.txt
cat notes.txt
```

### 🔎 What This Does

- `ls` → Lists files in the working directory.
- `>` → Creates or overwrites the file.
- `>>` → Appends new data to existing file.
- `cat` → Displays the entire file content.

# 2️⃣ Using tee (Append + Display)

### 🔹 Commands Executed

```bash
echo "Using tee to write and display output" | tee -a notes.txt
cat notes.txt
```

### 🔎 What This Does

- `tee -a` → Appends content to file.
- Simultaneously prints output to terminal.
- `cat` confirms updated file content.

# 3️⃣ Multiple Append & Final Verification

### 🔹 Commands Executed

```bash
echo "Learning how to use echo and save output to a file" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to view file content using cat" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to see the first few lines of a file using head" >> notes.txt
echo "practicing how to see the last few lines of a file using tail" >> notes.txt
echo "regular Linux practice improves skills" >> notes.txt

cat notes.txt
head -n 2 notes.txt
tail -n 2 notes.txt
```

### 🔎 What This Does

- Appends multiple lines using `>>`
- `cat` → Shows complete file
- `head -n 2` → Displays first two lines
- `tail -n 2` → Displays last two lines
