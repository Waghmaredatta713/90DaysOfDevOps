Q: What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

DevOps is a way of working where development and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and safely. It helps in automation, reducing errors, and making systems stable.
Cloud Engineering means using cloud platforms like AWS to run applications and manage servers instead of physical machines. It helps in scaling systems easily and managing infrastructure better.
I understand that DevOps is not only about tools. It is about culture, mindset, communication, automation, and continuous learning.



Q: Why Am I Starting DevOps?

I want to grow in my career and switch to a DevOps role. I want to learn modern technologies that companies are using today. I also want better career growth and technical skills.



Q: Where Do You Want to Reach?

In the next 90 days, I want to build a strong foundation in DevOps. I want to understand the full DevOps process clearly and feel confident using basic tools like Linux, Git, Docker, and CI/CD.
In the future, I want to become a DevOps Engineer who can handle deployments and solve problems independently.



Q: How Will You Stay Consistent Every Single Day?

I will study and practice for 2–3 hours every day at a fixed time. I will not skip any day. If I miss one day by mistake, I will complete the work the next day.
I will focus more on hands-on practice instead of only watching videos. I will upload my work on GitHub and track my progress.
Even if I feel tired, I will study something small. Consistency is more important than motivation.



My 90-Day Goals

Understand DevOps clearly from the basics and learn how the full process works.
Practice daily and become comfortable with Linux, Git, Docker, and CI/CD.
Learn to read logs, understand errors, and try to solve basic problems by myself.
My goal is not to become perfect in 90 days, but to build strong basics and improve step by step.
