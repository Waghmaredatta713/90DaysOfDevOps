# 90DaysOfDevOps

Name: Dattatray Waghmare
Current Level: Beginner in DevOps (Working Professional)
Location: Pune

Q: What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
Ans: DevOps is a way of working where developers and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and more safely. It helps in automating tasks, reducing errors, and making systems stable.
Cloud Engineering means using cloud platforms like AWS to run applications and manage servers instead of using physical machines. It makes systems flexible and easy to scale.
I understand that DevOps is not only about tools. It is about Culture, mindset, automation, Communication and continuous learning.

Q. Why I Am Starting DevOps
Ans: I want to grow in my career and i want to switch my Job

Q: Where do you want to reach?
Ans: In the next 90 days, I want to build a strong foundation in DevOps. I want to feel confident with Linux, Git, Docker, and basic CI/CD. 

Q: How you will stay consistent every single day?
Ans: I will practice DevOps for 2–3 hours every day at a fixed time and treat it seriously. I will not skip any day, but if I miss one by mistake, I will complete the work the next day without excuses. I will focus more on hands-on practice


My 90-Day Goals:

1. Understand DevOps clearly from the basics.
I want to understand how the full DevOps process works. I don’t want to just learn tools. I want to understand the overall framework and how everything connects.

2. Practice regularly and improve step by step.
I will practice every day and repeat important concepts. I will try things on my system instead of only watching videos. My goal is to become comfortable with Linux, Git, Docker, and CI/CD through continuous practice.

3. Learn to troubleshoot and solve problems by myself.
By the end of 90 days, I want to be able to read error messages, check logs, and try to fix issues on my own. I know I am a beginner, but I want to build confidence to handle basic incidents independently.
